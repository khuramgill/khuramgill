## Overview

Welcome to the Document Handling Windows Service project! This project showcases a C# Windows service developed to provide efficient document management solutions for a USA-based client. During my first-year summer, I had the privilege of working on this project, which significantly enhanced my confidence and deepened my understanding of industry practices.

## Features

- **Automated Document Processing**: The Windows service automates various document handling tasks, making the management and processing of documents more streamlined and error-free.

- **Background Operation**: The service operates in the background, independent of user interaction, ensuring that document management tasks are carried out seamlessly.

- **Integration with Data Sources**: I integrated the service with different data sources, allowing for seamless retrieval and storage of documents from various locations.

- **Client-Centric Approach**: Throughout the project, I actively communicated with the USA-based client, understanding their requirements and tailoring the solution to meet their specific needs.

## Key Takeaways

- **Real-World Experience**: Developing a Windows service for an industry client provided me with valuable insights into practical software development and the expectations of real-world projects.

- **Technical Skills**: I applied my C# skills to create a robust and reliable Windows service, gaining proficiency in creating background processes that handle critical tasks.

- **Client Interaction**: The experience of working closely with a client sharpened my communication and problem-solving skills, ensuring that the final solution met their expectations.
